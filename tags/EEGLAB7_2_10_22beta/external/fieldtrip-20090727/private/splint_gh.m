% first time commit to CVS, although the m-function already existed since 2004
% somehow it was always excluded from CVS because the mex files would do the work
% iin this version the original code is commented out and autocompilation of the mex file is attempted
%

% compile the missing mex file on the fly
% remember the original working directory
pwdir = pwd;

% determine the name and full path of this function
funname = mfilename('fullpath');
mexsrc  = [funname '.c'];
[mexdir, mexname] = fileparts(funname);

try
  % try to compile the mex file on the fly
  warning('trying to compile MEX file from %s', mexsrc);
  cd(mexdir);
  mex(mexsrc);
  cd(pwdir);
  success = true;

catch
  % compilation failed
  disp(lasterr);
  error('could not locate MEX file for %s', mexname);
  cd(pwdir);
  success = false;
end

if success
  % execute the mex file that was juist created
  funname   = mfilename;
  funhandle = str2func(funname);
  [varargout{1:nargout}] = funhandle(varargin{:});
