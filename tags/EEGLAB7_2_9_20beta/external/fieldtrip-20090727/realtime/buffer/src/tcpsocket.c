 * $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $
 * Revision 1.16  2009/01/23 19:47:50  roboos
 * changed verbosity
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2009/01/23 17:55:34  roboos
 * set request and response to NULL after cleanup, to ensure that they are not free'd twice
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2009/01/23 08:26:44  roboos
 * fixed a serious bug that caused a lot of memory to leak (in fact all packets that were sent over the socket would eventually leack away), both on the client and server side
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2009/01/21 20:54:35  roboos
 * added some debugging code to keep track of number of sockets and threads (both seem ok)
 * cleaned up the debugging: more consistent use of verbose flag and function name in fprintf
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2009/01/21 08:47:22  roboos
 * fixed bug in thread counting
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2009/01/21 08:33:01  roboos
 * added some code for debugging the leaking of sockets and threads
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2008/07/09 10:38:56  roboos
 * changed verbosity to 0, some changes in whitespace
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2008/05/22 13:39:01  roboos
 * moved declarations to top
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2008/05/22 09:49:32  roboos
 * some small changes by Jurgen Mellinger related to compatibility with Borland
 * moved linux and socket specific includes and defines into seperate header files
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2008/04/24 15:52:20  roboos
 * disabled the section on polling using a define, changed verbosity
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2008/03/26 14:36:52  thohar
 * minor portability stuff
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008/03/23 16:53:21  roboos
 * implemented thread cancelation, reactivated polling code, needed to detect closed socked
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008/03/13 13:40:54  roboos
 * changed handling input argument, added thread cancelation, changed cleanup (not yet final, since that would mean that it moves to the cleanup function)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/03/13 12:35:23  thohar
 * added headers for win32 build
 * removed polling as it is not neccessary and just eats up cpu-time
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2008/03/08 10:33:48  roboos
 * changed some code to reflect the renamed low-level functions, no functional changes
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2008/03/08 09:41:02  roboos
 * renamed buffer_thread function to tcpserver, idem for the c-file
 * renamed socket_thread function to tcpsocket, idem for the c-file
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2008/03/02 13:29:23  roboos
 * seperated socket and buffer-handing code
 * adde polling to the socket section
 * allow connections to remain open (i.e. multiple request/response pairs)
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2008/02/27 10:17:30  roboos
 * Use append() and message_t and messagedef_t in constructing the response in memory, delay the writing of the response to after the switch-ladder. All responses are now written the same way, equal to reading them. This allows for the next step, which should be to seperate this code into a buffer_request section and a socket/network specific section.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2008/02/26 21:43:26  roboos
 * renamed packet_t structure definition into messagedef_t, added message_t structure (contains def+buf)
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2008/02/20 13:41:06  roboos
 * malloc the datasel and eventsel, also if specified in buf (free buf immediately)
 * implemented delayed writing on socket for GET_DAT
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2008/02/20 07:14:02  roboos
 * added support for the other data types
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2008/02/19 17:22:38  roboos
 * added support for int32 data buffer
 * changed the verbosity
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2008/02/19 10:41:28  roboos
 * re-enabled the test for reading outside of the buffer
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008/02/19 10:22:56  roboos
 * added consistent copyrights and log message to each of the files
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008/02/19 09:29:25  roboos
 * replaced all read/write calls with bufread/bufwrite calls
 * fixed problem in offset calculation (accidentaly removed the (int) cast, which was meant for rounding off)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/02/19 09:08:32  roboos
 * moved some mutexes around
 * fixed a nasty bug in GET_EVT (offset beyond end of event buffer)
 * many small changes
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2008/02/18 12:13:46  roboos
 * moved executable from buffer to demo
 * fixed bugs in sinewave and socket for events
 * stripped down the eventdef_t fields
 * many small changes
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2008/02/18 10:05:27  roboos
 * restructured the directory layout, copied all code into src, added directory for external code
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2008/02/14 16:52:05  roboos
 * implemented GET_EVT in analogy with GET_DAT
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2008/02/13 13:59:03  roboos
 * made a start with implementing GET_EVT
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008/02/13 13:07:56  roboos
 * fixed numerous bugs
 * implemented append function, which after all does not seem to be neccessary (since the problem is in the TCP buffer size)
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008/02/11 21:16:23  roboos
 * after testing with a variety of messages, this version seems to be the first one that is fully functional
 * reimplemented many of the GET/PUT implementations based on the new header/data/event structures wheer each one ahs a def and a buf section
 * ensure that all pointers are set to NULL after a free()
 * print more debugging information
 * still to be done:
 * - add channel labels to header
 * - add channel selection to GET_DAT
 * - add event selection to GET_EVT
 * - implement mutexes around global memory access
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/02/10 20:28:05  roboos
 * implemented put_evt, get_dat
 * other small changes
 *
* Revision 1.2  2008/02/10 10:50:38  roboos
* made helper functions for freeing buffer
* made helper functions for initializing buffer
* implemented some commands
* at the moment probably not functional due to work-in-progress in GET_DAT, but for the rest it is tested and functional
*
* Revision 1.1  2008/02/09 16:44:26  roboos
* renamed network.c into socket.c
* made first skeleton implementation, seems partially functional
*
