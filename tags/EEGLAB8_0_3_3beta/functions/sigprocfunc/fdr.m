% fdr() - compute false detection rate mask
%
% Usage:
%   >> [p_fdr, p_masked] = fdr( pvals, alpha);
%
% Inputs:
%   pvals - vector or array of p-values
%   alpha - threshold value (non-corrected). If no alpha is given
%           each p-value is used as its own alpha and FDR corrected
%           array is returned.
%
% Outputs:
%   p_fdr    - pvalue used for threshold (based on independence
%              or positive dependence of measurements)
%   p_masked - p-value thresholded. Same size as pvals.
