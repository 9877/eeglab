Wish to adopt WinBugs style notation and add sampling engines.

i.e., for a normal distribution:

mu = dnorm(0,1);
tau = dgamma(0.1,0.1);
x = dnorm(mu,tau);

would in this form require undesirable reference behaviour.

mixture model on means:

lambda = [1 10];
T = dcat([0.4 0.6]);
mu = lambda(T);
x = dnorm(mu,1);

....
