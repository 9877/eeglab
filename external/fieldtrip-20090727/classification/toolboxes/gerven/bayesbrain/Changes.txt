List of changes to keep track of possible bugs:

gaussian_cpd.updateEM	      made any(w) the criterion instead of chi(j)
multinomial_cpd.updateEM      added pot.chi in pot.chi .* exp(pot.g); unsure about it




Bugs:
updateEM doesn't work well in combination with hmm mixture models
seems to break down in case of low probability events. could be explained
by the fact that a single gaussian models the behaviour best
check this by defining a mixture naive bayes model for the static case
and analyse if we can reproduce the failure
