function [CLASS,ERR,POSTERIOR,LOGP,COEF]=classify(sample,training,classlabel,TYPE)
% CLASSIFY classifies sample data into categories 
% defined by the training data and its group information 
%
%  CLASS = classify(sample, training, group) 
%  CLASS = classify(sample, training, group, TYPE) 
%  [CLASS,ERR,POSTERIOR,LOGP,COEF] = CLASSIFY(...) 
%
%  CLASS contains the assigned group. 
%  ERR is the classification error on the training set weighted by the 
%	prior propability of each group. 
%
%  The same classifier as in TRAIN_SC are supported. 
%
% ATTENTION: no cross-validation is applied, therefore the 
%    classification error is too optimistic (overfitting). 
%    Use XVAL instead to obtain cross-validated performance. 
% 
% see also: TRAIN_SC, TEST_SC, XVAL
