% Usage:    
%   >> [erp, t] = cls_readerp(ALLEEG, setind, component);  
%   This functions returns the ERP of an ICA component. 
%   The information is loaded from a float file, which a pointer 
%   to is saved in the EEG dataset. The float file was created
%   by the pre - clustering function cls_erp. 
%
% cls_readerp() - Given the ALLEEG structure, a specific EEG dataset index, 
% and a specific component, the function returns the ERP of that ICA component. 
% The ERP of the dataset ICA components is assumed to be saved in a float 
% file, the EEG dataset include a pointer to this file. If such a float file doesn't exist,
% you can use the cls_erp() function to create it, or use the pre - clustering functions
% that call it: pop_preclust, eeg_preclust & eeg_createdata.  
% Along with the ERP of the selected ICA component the function returns  
% the time vector of the ERP samples. 
%
%
% Inputs:
%   ALLEEG     - an EEGLAB data structure, which holds EEG sets (can also be one EEG set). 
%                      ALLEEG must contain the dataset of interest (the setind).
%   setind         -  [integer] an index of an EEG dataset in the ALLEEG
%                      structure, for which to get the component ERP.
%   component - [integer] a component index in the selected EEG dataset for which 
%                      an ERP will be returned. 
%
% Outputs:
%   erp            - the ERP of the requested ICA component in the
%                      selected dataset. This is the average of the ICA
%                      activation across all the epochs.
%   t              - a vector of the time points in which the ERP was computed.
